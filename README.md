# SUDNAXI - Professional Stock Trading Analysis Platform

After years of manually tracking stocks and struggling with fragmented tools, I built SUDNAXI to bring everything together in one powerful platform. This isn't just another trading app - it's a complete trading intelligence system that I've refined through countless hours of backtesting and real market experience.

What started as a personal project to improve my own trading decisions has evolved into a professional-grade platform that combines real-time market data, advanced technical analysis, and machine learning insights.

## Why I Built This

As someone who's been trading for years, I was frustrated by:
- Jumping between multiple platforms for different data
- Manually calculating technical indicators
- Missing important news that moved markets
- Lack of proper backtesting tools
- No way to learn from past decisions

So I built SUDNAXI to solve these problems once and for all.

## What You Get

### Real-Time Market Intelligence
- Live data from 9 major global markets (US, India, UK, Germany, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil)
- Professional-grade technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages)
- Smart signal generation with confidence scoring (-5 to +5)
- Clear buy/sell recommendations that actually make sense

### Advanced Analytics That Actually Work
- Backtesting engine that runs thousands of trades to prove strategies work
- News sentiment analysis that tracks what's really moving markets
- Analyst recommendation tracking with price target analysis
- Paper trading simulator to test strategies risk-free
- Smart position sizing based on actual risk assessment

### Advanced Features
- **Adaptive AI Strategies**: Real-time learning with 30-minute adaptation cycles
- **Continuous Learning Engine**: Strategy enhancement based on performance
- **Professional UI/UX**: Dark theme optimized for extended trading sessions
- **Interactive Charts**: Multiple chart types with signal overlays
- **Comprehensive Help System**: Educational tooltips and trading insights

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for market data

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r production_requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python start_app.py
   ```
   Or use Streamlit directly:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

### PyCharm Users
Run `start_app.py` directly in PyCharm instead of `app.py` to avoid context errors.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configurations:

```env
# Database (Optional - defaults to SQLite)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./trading_app.db

# Application Settings
DEBUG=False
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Optional API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here
```

### Database Options
- **SQLite** (Default): No additional setup required
- **PostgreSQL**: Set `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/trading_db`

## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Docker Build
```bash
docker build -t sudnaxi-trading .
docker run -p 8501:8501 sudnaxi-trading
```

## How I Built This

I chose technologies that are reliable and battle-tested:

- **Python**: Because it's perfect for financial data analysis
- **Streamlit**: Creates beautiful web apps without the complexity
- **Yahoo Finance**: Reliable, free market data that institutions use
- **SQLite**: Simple database that just works (no setup needed)
- **Plotly**: Professional charts that look amazing
- **Pandas**: The gold standard for data manipulation

Everything runs locally on your machine - no cloud dependencies or subscription fees.

## Development

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r production_requirements.txt

# Run in development mode
streamlit run app.py
```

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement functionality in appropriate module
3. Update configuration if needed
4. Test thoroughly
5. Update documentation

## If Something Goes Wrong

I've tested this extensively, but here are fixes for common issues:

**App won't start**:
- Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Run `pip install --upgrade pip` first
- Try the setup script again

**Slow performance**:
- Reduce the time range (try 1 month instead of 1 year)
- Refresh your browser
- Close other browser tabs

**Can't connect to data**:
- Check your internet connection
- Wait a few minutes (Yahoo Finance has rate limits)
- Try a different stock symbol

**Installation issues**:
- Use a virtual environment (the setup script creates one)
- Make sure you have admin rights on Windows

## Development Notes

This system was built with a focus on reliability, performance, and user experience. The architecture is designed to be maintainable and extensible, with clear separation of concerns between data processing, analysis, and presentation layers.

Key design decisions:
- SQLite for local development with PostgreSQL support for production
- Modular architecture for easy feature additions
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Real-time data processing with intelligent caching
- Professional UI/UX optimized for trading workflows
